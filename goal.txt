goal:

figure out which of the css variables, sideberry is using
for --frame-bg. 

it looks like based off a combination of:

1. some -moz variable, which almost always
seems to get mapped to a targetable --variable

2. a color-mix is then applied to this variable

part 1. could be
--sidebar-background-color
--toolbar-inactive 
--toolbar-bg
--toolbar-bgcolor
