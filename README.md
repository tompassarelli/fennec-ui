# Fennec UI
![Demo Screenshot](demo.png)

A customized Mozilla Firefox experience designed around minimalism and optimized vertical tab support. Achieved through userChrome.css modifications and cohesive extension integrations.

## Features

üîó **Enhanced Sideberry Integration** - Urlbar inside the sidebar-box, tracks sidebar width, and expands when focused

üßò **Zen Mode** - Toggling the sidebar hides the UI, maximizing screen space and aiding focus when tiled or maximized

‚ú® **Minimal Chrome** - Only essential objects exposed, coherent with a keyboard driven UX

üõ†Ô∏è **Community Minded** - Clean code and detailed docs to support customization and contribution, ensuring the project remains maintainable and sustainable

üé® **Theme Support** - System themes (light-dark) supported. User created Firefox themes are also supported.

## Installation

Note: Please see [security considerations](#security-considerations) before installing

1. Set Firefox's Browser Layout to Fennec's supported configuration
   - Goto settings in firefox
   - In search bar, Type "Hori".
     - You should now see "Browser Layout" in the search results
   - Enable "Horizontal Tabs" if it is not enabled
   - "Show Sidebar" is off 
     - not supported (just use hotkeys to switch to history/bookmarks/gpt as desired)
   - Sidebar is configured to appear on left side (browser default)
2. Add userChrome.css to your chrome folder
   - Enable firefox to be able to use userChrome.css
     - `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` in `about:config`
   - Navigate to your profile directory
      - Note: on the Flatpak version of Firefox the profile directory is `~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>`
      - Open Firefox
      - Type `about:support` in the address bar and press enter
      - Look for the Application Basics section.
      - Click on Open Profile Folder. This will open the folder which contains your user data.
   - Add a chrome folder and userChrome.css
      - Now create a `chrome` folder in your profile folder if it doesn't exist
      - Copy `userChrome.css` to the `chrome` folder, from this repo's chrome folder
3. Configure Sideberry
   - Install [Sideberry extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/)
   - Use sideberry.css from this repo in the sideberry custom css settings
4. Restart Firefox

### Optional Recommended Extensions
- **[Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/)** - Keyboard-driven navigation that complements the minimal, distraction-free interface

## Usage Guide

Utilizing the chosen hotkey for user chrome toggle hides the whole UI

This elegant toggle gives you the best of both worlds - organized tab management when you need it, a clean browsing experience when you don't

## Security Considerations

- The install guide directs users to download Firefox extensions. Firefox extensions can introduce security vulnerabilities and/or take direct hostile actions against users. 
- Zen Mode hides the UI which obviously suppresses security signals like padlock warnings. In appreciation of this concern, Fennec will still attempt to surface some security warnings (ex. HTTP Not Secure) prepended to page content as a header alert. Not a solution against phishing and other attacks/vulnerabilities, only toggle the UI after the page has been verified as secure and trustworthy.
