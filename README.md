# Fennec UI
![Demo Screenshot](demo.png)

A customized Mozilla Firefox experience designed around minimalism and optimized vertical tab support. Achieved through userChrome.css modifications and cohesive extension integrations.

Inspired by the elegant UX of Zen Browser, GNU/Linux, and Vim.

## Features

üîó **Enhanced Sideberry Integration** - Urlbar inside the sidebar-box, tracks sidebar width, and expands when focused

üßò **Zen Mode** - Toggling the sidebar hides the UI, maximizing screen space and aiding focus when tiled or maximized

‚ú® **Minimal Chrome** - Only essential objects exposed, coherent with a keyboard driven UX

üõ†Ô∏è **Community Minded** - Clean code and detailed docs to support auditing, customization, and contribution, ensuring the project remains maintainable and sustainable

üé® **Theme Support** - Use your favorite Firefox theme to further personalize your experience

## Disclaimer

- The install guide directs users to download Firefox extensions. Firefox extensions can introdue security vulnerabilities or take direct hostile actions against users. 
- Zen Mode hides the UI which obviously suppresses security signals like padlock warnings. In appreciation of this concern, Fennec will still attempt to surface some security warnings (ex. HTTP Not Secure) prepended to page content as a header alert. Not a solution against phishing and other attacks, only toggle the UI after the page has been verified as secure and trustworthy.

- **You are responsible** for verifying the security of websites, code, and extensions used
