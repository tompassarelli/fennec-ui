# Fennec UI
![Demo Screenshot](demo.png)

A customized Mozilla Firefox experience designed around minimalism and optimized vertical tab support. Achieved through userChrome.css modifications and cohesive extension integrations.

## Features

üîó **Enhanced Sideberry Integration** - Urlbar inside the sidebar-box, tracks sidebar width, and expands when focused

üßò **Zen Mode** - Toggling the sidebar hides the UI, maximizing screen space and aiding focus when tiled or maximized

‚ú® **Minimal Chrome** - Only essential objects exposed, coherent with a keyboard driven UX

üõ†Ô∏è **Community Minded** - Clean code and detailed docs to support customization and contribution, ensuring the project remains maintainable and sustainable

üé® **Theme Support** - System themes (light-dark) supported. User created Firefox themes are also supported.

## Installation

Note: Please see [security considerations](#security-considerations) before installing

1. Install [Sideberry extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/)
2. Set Firefox's Browser Layout to Fennec's supported configuration
   - Goto settings in firefox
   - In search bar, type "hori" (searching for horizontal tabs)
     - You should now see "Browser Layout" in the search results
   - Enable "Horizontal Tabs" if it is not enabled
   - "Show Sidebar" is off 
     - not supported (just use hotkeys to switch to history/bookmarks/gpt as desired)
   - Sidebar is configured to appear on left side (browser default)
3. Add CSS files (userChrome.css to chrome folder, sideberry.css to its Styles editor)
   - Enable firefox to be able to use userChrome.css
     - `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` in `about:config`
   - Navigate to your profile directory
      - Note: on the Flatpak version of Firefox the profile directory is `~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/<profile>`
      - Open Firefox
      - Type `about:support` in the address bar and press enter
      - Look for the Application Basics section.
      - Click on Open Profile Folder. This will open the folder which contains your user data.
   - Add a chrome folder and userChrome.css
      - Now create a `chrome` folder in your profile folder if it doesn't exist
      - Copy `userChrome.css` to the `chrome` folder, from this repo's chrome folder
   - Insert sideberry.css from this repo in the sideberry custom css settings
      - Right click on sideberry extension and open settings, or in the extension menu select the gear icon
      - Scroll down the settings section until the end, you should see "Styles Editor" tab on the left hand side, second to last option
      - There is a code area on the right hand of the screen, paste css code in there
4. Restart Firefox

### Optional Recommended Extensions
- **[Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/)** - Keyboard-driven navigation that complements the minimal, distraction-free interface

## Security Considerations

- The install guide directs users to download Firefox extensions. Firefox extensions can introduce security vulnerabilities and/or take direct hostile actions against users. 
- Zen Mode hides the UI which obviously suppresses security signals like padlock warnings. In appreciation of this concern, Fennec will still attempt to surface a custom HTTP Not Secure security warning prepended to page content as a header alert. Not a solution against phishing and other attacks/vulnerabilities, only toggle the UI after the page has been verified as secure and trustworthy.
- **Use at your own risk** - The author is not liable for any security issues, data breaches, or other damages of usage of this repository or mentioned extensions.
- **You are responsible** for verifying the security of websites, code, and extensions used
- Always keep Firefox updated

**By using this theme and mentioned Firefox extensions, you acknowledge these risks and agree that the author bears no responsibility for any consequences.**
