## Disclaimer

- The install guide directs users to download Firefox extensions, which can introdue security vulnerabilities or take direct hostile actions against users. 
- Zen Mode hides the UI which obviously suppresses security signals like padlock warnings. In appreciation of this concern, Fennec will still attempt to surface some security warnings (ex. HTTP Not Secure) prepended to page content as a header alert. Not a solution against phishing and other attacks, only toggle the UI after the page has been verified as secure and trustworthy.
