# ðŸ¦Š Fennec UI

![Demo Screenshot](demo.png)

*Clean browsing with integrated Sideberry sidebar - no visual clutter, just pure functionality.*

A minimal Firefox CSS theme designed for **first-class Sideberry support** without the typical Firefox UI baggage. Inspired by the elegant UX philosophy of Zen Browser.

Not a fork! Perfect for users who want the stability of Firefox with a few quality enhancements.

- ðŸ”— **Seamless Sideberry Integration** - Urlbar inside the sidebar-box, aligned url and icons

- âœ¨ **Minimal Chrome** - Remove unnecessary Firefox UI elements that clutter the experience  

- ðŸŽ¨ **Theme Support** - Use your favorite Firefox themes, with sideberry optimizations done for you

- ðŸ§˜ **Zen-Mode** - Toggle the entire ui by toggling the sidebar

When the UI is completely hidden, fennec will attempt (no garuntee, firefox chrome changes can break logic) to surface some but not all security relevant signals (like http warning). This is not a solution against phishing and many other attacks, users should only toggle the UI after url/content has been verified as secure
